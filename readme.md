# ðŸ“ž Project Overview: Unraveling the Mystery of Customer Churn at Telco ðŸ“Š

Telco has elevated levels of customers canceling their services or churning. I am tasked with identifying the drivers of customer churn and producing recommendations on how to reduce it. 

**ðŸš€ The Challenge**: Telco, a leading telecommunications company, is grappling with an increasing rate of customer churn. They've turned to me to unravel the mystery behind this trend and devise strategies to curb it. 

**ðŸŽ¯ Mission**: To identify the key factors driving customer churn at Telco and build a machine learning model that accurately predicts customer churn. I aim to present the findings in a comprehensive report that anyone, even those without a data science background, can understand and act upon.

**ðŸ’¡ Hypothesis**: I suspect that churn might be linked to higher monthly costs and the length of the contract. But let's dive in and see what the data tells us!

# ðŸ“‹ Game Plan:

1. **Data Acquisition**: Fetch data from the Codeup SQL database.
2. **Data Preparation**: Create calculated columns from existing data, such as tenure and churn.
3. **Data Exploration**: Investigate potential drivers of churn. I will be asking questions like: Does higher monthly cost contribute to more customer churn? Does any individual customer attribute contribute more to customer churn?
4. **Model Development**: Build and evaluate various predictive models using the identified drivers. The best model will be selected based on its accuracy.
5. **Conclusion**: Draw insights and make recommendations based on my findings.

Want to dive into the data yourself? Here's how:

1. Clone this repo.
2. Get credentials from Codeup to query their telco_churn dataset.
3. Ensure the acquire.py, prepare.py, env.py, and telco_functions.py are in the same folder as the final notebook.
4. Run the final notebook.

# Takeaways:

- The customers table appears to be created from the other existing tables. The data in the customers.tenure column is suspicious when compared to a calculation of total_charges/monthly_charges. For this reason I did not use the customers table and created a new tenure column by dividing total_charges by monthly_charges.
- It appears the data was retrieved on 2022-01-31. This is also the date for all churn customers.
- Creating DataFrame of just churned customers and another of not churned customers was very useful. It shows the rate at which each feature occured in both groups. I focused on the top and bottom four.

# Conclusions:

Churn occurs at 27% in the Telco dataset. The drivers of churn are: 
- Having a month-to-month contract
- Not having tech support
- Not having online security
- Having fiber optic internet
- Low tenure/being a new customer
- Higher monthly charges

# Recommendations

- Evaluate pricing and quality of fiber optic internet service.
- Evaluate pricing and impact of tech support and online security.
- Incentivize Month-to-month and fiber optic customers to stay.
- Consider lowering prices for newer customers.
- Once churn decreases, evaluate pricing power on phone services and two year contracts.

# Next Steps
- Do statistical testing on the monthly_charges and total_charges features
- Create a way to automatically compare churn for continuous features
- Dig in deeper on features which have greater than 10% indication of churn.
- Evaluate fiber optic internet type to identify focus areas.
